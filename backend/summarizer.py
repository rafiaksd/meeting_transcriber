 Now let's get to the third raw truth. Because now you have your negative future vision. You know exactly where you don't want to end up at. And you know that the only way not to end up there is by taking action now and changing the route you're going down. So here's the very first thing you need to change if you want to be successful. And this brings us on to raw truth numbers three which is, if you don't go fast, you'll fail. You need to understand that when you're first starting out, a lot of things are going to go wrong. And your best weapon against things going wrong is speed. You see, there's really only one way for you to improve your life. And it's trying out something new and experiencing a result of it. Now this new thing you tried might work or might not work. Whatever the outcome is, you're going to learn. And as a result, you either got better or you learned what not to do next time. But the important thing for you to understand is the faster you go to these optimization cycles, the faster that you're in come a little. If one person has to find new things in a certain timeframe and another person tests 20 new things during the exact same timeframe, yes what? The person who tested 20 new things wins every single time. Even if every single thing the first person tested works out as expected. Because the number of iterations of the second person went through is just so much greater. And it's that simple. And that is why speed of implementation is one of the key traits of successful individuals. They are fast executors. I mean, just look at Elon. What was the first thing he did when he took over Twitter? He looked at how often new updates were being pushed. And then he looked at who the people were contributing to getting these updates pushed. You're not contributing? Cool, fired. And then after firing over 80% of the company, what did he focus on next? Getting new updates. Pushing updates 10 times more often. Why? Because he understands that makes or breaks a company speed. You want to be able to do things quickly. You're trying to learn how to become a millionaire yourself. Or maybe you're just trying to learn how to start a business. Or how to improve financially. Whatever it is, you need to understand this. The quicker you start implementing, the quicker you start making money. So if you can cut your learning curve, that is always going to pay dividends. Because the longer it takes to get something done, the less money it is going to make. If it takes you three months to get started with something and someone else starts to be exact same thing in one month, that person is going to make more money. Why? Because of something called opportunity cost. I mean, first, they're going to be making money during those two extra months that you aren't producing anything. So that money is lost to gone. And second and most importantly, during those two months, they will go through so many of these improvement cycles that I just mentioned earlier that you simply won't ever be able to catch up with them. Because they have the advantage of speed. So whatever you are trying to learn or do, it is your duty to figure out how you can learn and implement it as fast as you normally possible. You either do it fast or you fail.

 I think that the people who are the most focused, when you actually watch them, you would be astounded by basically how simple it is. It's just that it's very difficult. It's simple in that it's easy to understand, difficult in that it's hard to execute. If you watch someone write a book for 16-hour straight they're like, okay, that's what's writing a book for six-near Australia's. But what you don't see is all of the prepping the table for the work that happened prior to and in the years leading up. So almost every billionaire that I know in my life maintains such a clean space, physically and then more importantly, emotionally clean space. As in, the people that they allow in their circles, they have one razor that they use to judge them, which is, does this person increase or decrease the likelihood that I achieve my goals? So just having this person in my life, does having this habit in my life, does having this phone call, does having this brunch, does having this weekend trip, does it increase your decrease the likelihood I achieve my goals? And I think that a lot of you in the beginning are so afraid and to be fair, even as you progress, because it happens in levels, are so afraid of cutting things out because you have a fear that you'll never get it back. You have a fear that that cut is permanent. You have a fear that if you miss out on this fantasy football season that you'll never get invited back. But there's two things that you'll have to remember, which is that one, a more capable version of you, will have more doors that open than you do today. And so you'll never lack for opportunity, lack for opportunity, business or lack for opportunity, friends, if you get better, the reverse is not true. If you get Lamer and you stand finished football, they still may not invite you back, but then you've lost both. And so I had yet to have more doors closed for me in the future than I have had in the past, because the trade that you make is becoming better, and there will always be more doors for better people. And the only way that you get there, sometimes is by closing the doors in front of you today. And so there's just this fallacy that it's an irreversible decision, but it's not even that it's irreversible. Let's say there is a door that's irreversibly closed. The fallacy is that a better door does not exist in the world, and that a better version of you wouldn't have access to it. And that's the real fallacy. And so that's my encouragement. That means that there is a better friend of yours than your current best friend that exists for a better version of you. There's a better hobby for you than the one that you currently have when you are better and you are more able and you have more resources. And so I know how scary it is at any level to cut people out. I cut people out today, like all the time. Like in this year, I've cut multiple people out of my life. So it doesn't end. What happens is your standard raises, your standard, your bar of who's allowed in your space, because as your goal is getting bigger, new people or rather old people fail the new standard. So does this person increase your decrease of likely that I achieve million dollar status in my life? Well, I mean, I'm already there. So they don't need to hit that bar. They've already kind of crossed it. There's still my life already hit it. But this is person increase of decrease that I hit the like that that I get $10 billion in my life. No, I don't think this person's gonna be somebody's gonna increase that likely it. If not, then why keep them? And so a lot of you guys are doing this for different reasons. And I can appreciate and respect that. But I would posit that the reason that matters most is who you become along the way. And I have yet to see a person who accomplishes more by taking on more. The big, a lot of big truths are inverted. Like you get the most by giving the most. You get the most done by taking the least on. And so it's these ideas that like the thing is is what feels intuitive if the intuitive answer were the correct answer, then everyone would already be achieving it. And so it's the counter-intuitive solutions that we have to be mindful of. Because those are the ones that don't seem right at first glance, but only people who have the procedural knowledge of having gone through it, who can kind of lead the breadcrumbs and say, no, like you really do have to focus. It makes sense that if you did five businesses, all five should grow, but it's not reality. So it's counter-intuitive that one business will outgrow five if you actually focus on it. And all of the effort you have also at a micro level, you have five tasks just in that one business. If you focus on the one task that matters most and you put all your research towards it, it will grow the whole business more than trying to do five. And so it happens all the way down. And the only way you can do that is by clearing the way. And I would say that most of the times when I talk that portfolio founders that we have, most of what I talk about is what they're not going to do. Now what they are, just being very real. A lot of the strategy is, what are you not going to do? And one thing if we accomplished it would be so big or so important that it would make these other things irrelevant. And so I try and take our priorities list of five things and say what one thing matters and let's erase the other four. And if we just did this one, we will succeed. And so right now, I'm going to bring this home for you. Many of you have this big lit, who here has a big list of things that they know they should do right now, just give me a little shout out in the chat. Who here has, well, that's the massive list, right? Huge list of things that you know you should do. So lean into this, all right? So pay attention, this is for you. I need you to take that whole list and pick one thing and then erase the rest. And then once you complete that one thing, you do no other task besides that one thing. That means the next time you sit down, you eat, you come back, you keep back on the task, right? And if you need to buy a little timer or you do it on your phone, get a little timer and actually see what your time on task is. Say how long you think this should take, take an estimate. And what you will find oftentimes is that something you think will take two hours, sometimes takes 20 minutes. But the pain of trying to figure it out. So it might take you 10 actual minutes to figure it out. And then two minutes to do it. And so the thing is, is that a lot of the work that you have right now, especially when it's the most important work in the business, is work you don't know how to do. Because if you know how to do it, you'd already start it. And so it's the unknown that creates the delay. It's the fear of being inadequate, the fear failure, because we have it all the time we all have it. And so if you can define part of the problem solving, as wrapping your arms around the problem, understanding the problem is part of the problem solution. Then you won't feel like you're being unproductive as you take 45 minutes to understand the problem in five minutes to solve it. And so right now, you'd also be amazed at how much easier it is to solve problems when you're only trying to solve one. And so when you try to solve five at the same time, you're so spread thin and you're bouncing between different things that are contingencies one another. When if you just solve one, the amount of mental bandwidth, like basically said differently, you can be a lot dumber and wind if you only try to solve one thing at a time. And so there's a reason that I have this tweet that went really viral, but a focused fool can accomplish more than a distracted genius. And so I've met a lot of you. And you're very smart, be you're distracted. You're easy to beat. I'd be grateful to compete against you, because I know I wouldn't even be in competing against you. I'd be competing against all the other things that are competing against you. Because all I gotta do is beat one, 20th of you, not that hard no matter how smart you are. And so what's interesting is that a good visual for this is if you think about yourself as the sun, like you're the energy source, right in your world. And you need to burn through a whole through a piece of paper. Like that's what you have to get through. A sun has more than enough power to burn through it. But if the sun is evenly spread, it just warms up the paper, but it doesn't even break through. But if you take the magnifying glass, even a small amount of magnifying glass, you'll be able to burn the whole through. But you have to focus all of that energy on one point. And so many of you have sons and sons worth of energy, but you're so spread thin that all you do is warm your stuff up. You never cook it, you never break through. And you would be amazed at how much more you can accomplish when you only have one thing to do. And here's the second one, this one's that you want another counter-tuitable you want one-expect. Is that the speed of doing five things in a row is faster than doing five at the same time? So if you do number one, and then because you know these other four things are still important, so that these other four drive you do number one faster because you're like, shit, I still have to do these other four. So then you get number one down in the, I got it, now I'm gonna start at number two. So you start at number two, you're like, I still have to do two, three and four. But the problem is, because you haven't been able to prioritize, you haven't been able to focus on what one thing is the most important. You are afraid of having it take too long so you start on all five and in so doing make it take way longer than it would have taken to begin with. And so I would say if I had to tell the R this, this is about how to work and it works at all seasons, whether you're advanced or you're starting out, it's just that the nature of the distraction change, but the highest output work process remains the same. It's just that the quality and quantity for distractions improve the better you get. And so it's a lesson you have to relearn at every level. And so with that my friends, I think we could transition to the A's and Q's. I hope that was interesting for you guys. It's just been something that I've seen within the community. A lot. And I think that if you got like, if you, I'm being real with you guys, if you need accountability, you're never gonna win. To a known's gonna tell you, if you need accountability, you're not gonna make it. So you need to be your own witness. Like if you can't be adult enough in your own life to be the person that you wanna hold yourself accountable to, then you need to go fix that. I think Epic Titus is this great quote. He said, if you need, do you know what that quote is? I know you do, Kirby. This is one of my favorite, I said if you ever attempted to look for outside approval, realize that you have compromised your integrity, if you need a witness, be your own. And so I'll say it differently. If you are ever tempted to look for outside accountability, realize that you have compromised your integrity, because if you need someone to hold you accountable, it should be you. Because no one's gonna save you."""
